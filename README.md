Challenges:
Prior to this project, I had been coding without following an organized coding paradigm. I decided to challenge myself and write this program using Object Oriented Design principles. Initially, I had trouble utilizing these principles, but by looking at examples of well written code, I was able to emulate (to the best of my abilities) the design into my own. I noticed that my code became more loosely coupled than before; an error in one function did not break my entire code. My code was neatly packaged as objects, and each object had their own relevant methods attached. As a result, this program was easier to debug and more maintainable than my previous projects.
